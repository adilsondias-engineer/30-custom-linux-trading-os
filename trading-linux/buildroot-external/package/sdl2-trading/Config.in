	  SDL2 library built from local source at /work/tos/SDL.
	  
	  This custom build ensures proper DRM/KMS support for NVIDIA drivers.
	  Built with:
	  - --enable-video-kmsdrm (DRM/KMS video driver - CRITICAL for NVIDIA)
	  - --enable-video-dummy (fallback driver)
	  - --disable-video-x11 (no X11)
	  - --disable-video-wayland (no Wayland)
	  - --disable-video-opengl (no OpenGL, use software rendering)
	  
	  REQUIRES LOCAL SOURCE:
	  - /work/tos/SDL (SDL2 source directory)
	  
	  Note: SDL2_image and SDL2_ttf are provided by Buildroot's standard
	  packages and will work with this custom SDL2 build.
