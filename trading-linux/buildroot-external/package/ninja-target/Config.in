	  Ninja build system for target.
	  
	  Ninja is a small build system with a focus on speed. It differs
	  from other build systems in two major respects: it is designed to
	  have its input files generated by a higher-level build system, and
	  it is designed to run builds as fast as possible.
	  
	  This package installs ninja on the target system, required by meson
	  and other build systems.
