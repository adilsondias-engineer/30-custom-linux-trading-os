	  XGBoost is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library.

	  IMPORTANT: XGBoost 3.2 only works with CUDA 13.0, NOT 13.1.
	  CUDA 13.1 has CCCL 3.1.2 which breaks XGBoost 3.x compatibility.
	  
	  REQUIRES LOCAL FILES:
	  - /work/tos/xgboost (git repository)

	  XGBoost version to build.
	  
	  Use 3.2.0 (main branch) for latest features and CUDA 13.0 support.
	  Stable release is 3.1.2, but 3.2.0-dev on main has better CUDA support.
